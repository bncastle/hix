# Hix

## Introduction

Hix removes the need for build.hxml files or command line arguments to the haxe compiler.
Instead, the compilation flags are stored in the source code where the main class is located
using special headers stored in comments near the top of the file.

## How to Use

TODO: Describe the various options available

Any valid argument to Haxe.exe is supported

in the end, you type: *hix file.hx*

to build from Haxe source.
